- **Year 3:** $200,000  
- **Year 4:** $350,000  
- **Year 5:** $500,000  

### Justification for Revenue Projections
Revenue projections are based on a **conservative, side-business approach**, focusing on non-profits and higher education customers:  

1. **Market Research:**  
   - Non-profits and universities often have limited budgets but represent a large, underserved market.  
   - Ticketopiaâ€™s affordable pricing and flexible deployment options make it an attractive choice for these customers.  

2. **Pricing Model:**  
   - Ticketopia offers discounted pricing for non-profits and universities:  
     - **10-User Group Plan:** $499/month or $4,999/year (discounted from $699/month).  
     - **Unlimited Users Plan:** $1,499/month or $14,999/year (discounted from $1,999/month).  
   - Assuming a mix of customers:  
     - **Year 1:** 20 customers on the 10-user plan and 5 customers on the unlimited plan = **$179,880 annually**.  
     - Adjusted for conservative estimates (accounting for slower growth as a side business): **$50,000**.  

3. **Growth Assumptions:**  
   - **Year 1:** Focus on building the product, acquiring early adopters, and refining the offering.  
   - **Year 2:** Increased marketing efforts and partnerships drive **100% growth** to **$100,000**.  
   - **Year 3:** Established reputation in the non-profit and higher education space drives **100% growth** to **$200,000**.  
   - **Year 4:** Expanded customer base and upselling drive **75% growth** to **$350,000**.  
   - **Year 5:** Strong brand presence and enterprise deals drive **43% growth** to **$500,000**.  

4. **Conservative Approach:**  
   - Projections account for slower growth as a side business.  
   - Upselling and add-on revenue are not included but could significantly boost revenue over time.
